        <p>
          You can also search by the original (language) title of the movie.
          When searching for a title, it searches the list of movies related to
          the searched name at the same time. If you can't remember the exact
          title name, try entering the letters one by one, and you'll be able to
          find the relevant title under the search bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, search results are sensitive. Please check for typos in the
          name of the movie you are searching for.
