## Self-improvement
> In the past, while creating a website, I took note of the parts that could be improved or that were difficult at the time to develop the website.
So I updated the old website with reference to this note for self-development. My Old Site - [Link](https://github.com/SunilPark1129/spotless)

- [x] I had trouble deciding on a class name. I feel the need to further consider and improve naming practices.
  - Elements are written with related names to indicate what they mean. I've been studying a lot, but I think I still need to study more.
- [x] I need to pay more attention to css styling to develop myself. For example, I need to add more animation effect elements.
  - I studied a lot of CSS effects such as animation. However, I did not add them because they are not necessary for this website.
(Functions that can be rendered are divided into different file).
